Expressions
-----------

Cantilever consists of the following expression types:

Words `w`
Numbers `-1`, `0`, `1`, `77355`, `0xfff`...
Quotations (anonymous functions) `[` ... `]`
Word suffixes `__s`
Literal data prefixes `P__`
Number base prefixes `0b__`


The values of these expressions:

* A word is any non-null string of 127 bytes, where each byte has an ASCII value greater than 32. Words may correspond to an entry in a global data structure called the dictionary which maps words onto executable code.
* Numbers are 32 bit integers. Whether they are treated as signed or unsigned depends upon the word being applied to the number.
* A quotation is a value which, when passed to `eval` behaves like the function it contains.


### Immediates

	0x90# blah#

pushes `0x90` onto the stack and calls the dictionary word `blah`


### Quotations

	blah'

pushes the literal string "blah" onto the stack

	blah`

or

	__$: find code ;
	blah$

pushes the code address of dictionary word `blah` onto the stack
